Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and includes an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for database interactions.

Here's a brief overview of how to get started with Django:

Install Django:
You can install Django using pip, the Python package installer. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

Copy code
pip install Django
Create a Django Project:
After installing Django, you can create a new project using the following command:

Copy code
django-admin startproject projectname
Replace "projectname" with the desired name for your project.

Navigate to Your Project:
Change into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd projectname
Run Migrations:
Django uses migrations to manage database schema changes. Run the following commands to apply migrations:

Copy code
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Create a Django App:
Django projects are made up of apps. You can create a new app using the following command:

Copy code
python manage.py startapp appname
Replace "appname" with the desired name for your app.

Define Models:
In your app, define models in the models.py file. Models represent database tables.

Create Superuser:
To interact with the Django admin interface, create a superuser using the following command:

Copy code
python manage.py createsuperuser
Run the Development Server:
Start the development server to see your application in action:

Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Visit http://localhost:8000 in your web browser to view your Django app.

Explore Django Documentation:
Django has comprehensive documentation available at https://docs.djangoproject.com/. It covers all aspects of the framework and is a valuable resource as you develop your project
